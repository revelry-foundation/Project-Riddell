# Nightingale

## Background

Our goal: **prototype and validate/invalidate an Open Source Contact Tracing App that automates, securely and anonymously, the contact tracing process.**

While we work on creating a robust `README` for this Open Source project, interested parties can find our WIP via [this public Google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ob3Z_RxdGALPhl3V0XqQhLLYLYKKmMRXHf3fGT640rE/edit).

## Discussion

We encourage discussion to occur using the Comments on Issues and their respective Pull Requests. We find it important to capture questions and decisions as close to where the work is committed, so we lean on GitHub Comments.

For general discussion, deliberation, and planning, we encourage you to join the [**#tracing** Slack channel](https://revelry-public.slack.com/archives/C014AR56T1P) in the Revelry Public Slack. Not yet a member? Gain access via [https://community.revelry.co](https://community.revelry.co)
