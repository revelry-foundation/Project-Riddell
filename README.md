## Background

Our goal: **prototype and validate/invalidate an Open Source Contact Tracing App that automates, securely and anonymously, the contact tracing process.**

While we work on creating a robust `README` for this Open Source project, interested parties can find our WIP via [this public Google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ob3Z_RxdGALPhl3V0XqQhLLYLYKKmMRXHf3fGT640rE/edit).
